## Week [4] — [What If AI Could Creat?]

### This Week's Method
In class we applied the method Comparative Analysis. For almost the second half of the class, we have compared and input same ideas into 4 sentiment models: GPT 2, GPT 2 small, GPT 1, and GPT 5.4 (which is the model that most people use right now). We then looked at the different outputs caused by the the difference between the datasets. 

### How I Applied It
I find that the topic of reimagining an angle for the same picture using AI very interesting. I have found 1 model and 2 spaces that explores this idea while I was searching through Hugging Face. The model is called fal/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Multiple-Angles-LoRA, and it outputs the content of an image being shown at a different angle based on your input references using apparently, LoRA adapter. The spaces do pretty much the same thing, and they're called Qwen-Camera-Angles-Rethink and Qwen-Image-Edit-Angles. I didn't get the model to work since I have no idea of how to extract the code from the website. For the spaces, I input a picture of a bee on a flower and a picture of a goat standing on a mountain, and I input to turn the angle 90 degrees to the right for both spaces. 

### What I Expected
I expected both of the spaces to mess up the general shape of the animals in the picture, since it can be hard for the Al models to handle the details of the picture, and it can be hard for them to tell which object in the picture needs to be blurred. For example: the flower in the bee picture needs to be blurred since the main part of the photo is the bee. 

### What I Found
For the Qwen Camera Angles Rethink, It did a pretty good job on eachh of the pictures, but the only thing missing is that it made one of the bee's legs larger for that photo in the output. Also for the goat picture, it made the fur of the goat longer than the original. For the Qwen Image Edit Angles, everything went super smooth, but for the rocks on the mountain in the goat picture, it apparently did not know what to do when it comes to the textures of the rocks: they're just chaotic is all. 

### Why I Think This Happened
The reason for what happened is probably both the spaces don't aquire models that's intentionally trained for analyzing the details of animals and other objects, and therefore both of the spaces are just used for angle switching only. I think the reason that the Qwen Image Edit Angles space did a better job than the other one is that it's better at telling the distance of an object to the camera, since it didn't confuse and merge the legs of the bee like the Qwen Camera Angles Rethink: there's one leg in front and the one leg in the back, which is almost covered by the front one. 

### Limitations
I only input pictures of animals, and these spaces might be better at analyzing other stuff rather than animals. Also, When I tried to run another space I found on hugging face to increase the sample size for this topic, the system said I have hit the limit of quotas, which I didn't understand what that is and I can't run anything again for that day. 

### What I Want to Try Next
I want to find a model / space that is trained for analyzing animals while having the ability of switching the angle of a picture.
